INSTALLATION

To compile and run devilish, enter:

    make clean
    make
    ./devilish

If for any reason the makefile doesn't work as expected, manual compilation can be done with:

    gcc -o devilish devilish.c

devilish is tested to be compatible with the c89, c99, c11, gnu89, gnu99, and gnu11 standards, and is tested to work with gcc versions 4.8.5 to 8.1.0.

UNINSTALLATION

    make uninstall
